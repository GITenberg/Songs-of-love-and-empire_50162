In the Tideway<br />
<br />
By FLORA ANNIE STEEL<br />
<br />
(<i>Author of “Miss Stuart’s Legacy,” “On the Face of the<br />
Waters,” etc.</i>)<br />
<br />
6<i>s.</i><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“One has grown accustomed to the association of Mrs. Steel’s name
with novels which deal exclusively with Indians and Anglo-Indians.
Such powerful and remarkable books as ‘The Potter’s Thumb’ and ‘On
the Face of the Waters,’ point to a specialism which is becoming
one of the salient features of modern fiction; but ‘In the
Tideway,’ although dealing entirely with England and Scotland,
presents the same keen and unerring grasp of character, the same
faculty of conveying local atmosphere and colour, the same talent
for creating strong and dramatic situations, and the same
originality of thought and expression.... It is too late in the day
to speak of Mrs. Steel’s position. This is assured, but <i>this book
adds greatly to an established position</i>. <i>It is profoundly
impressive.</i>”</p>

<p>“Wonderfully bright and lively both in dialogue and
incidents.”&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>“Admirably written.”&mdash;<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p>

<p>“The story is beyond question powerful. The characters are
life-like and the dialogue is bright and natural.”&mdash;<i>Manchester
Guardian.</i></p>

<p>“As it is, the book is a sheer triumph of skill, one degree perhaps
less valuable than a fully conceived presentation of the actual,
but none the less admirable within its limits. There is care shown
in every character.... But the real art, perhaps, lies less in the
sequence of events or the portrayal of character, than in just this
subtle suggestion everywhere of the abiding causeless mystery of
land and sea.”&mdash;<i>Academy.</i></p></div>

aside.”&mdash;<i>The Lady.</i></p>

<p>“It holds us enthralled.”&mdash;<i>The Literary World.</i></p>

<p>“The idea is so novel that one gasps, as it were, at its
originality. A romance far above the ordinary production.”&mdash;<i>St.
Paul’s.</i></p>

<p>“Much loving and happy human nature, much heroism, much
faithfulness, much dauntless hope, so that as one phantasmal
ghastliness follows another in horrid swift succession the reader
is always accompanied by images of devotion and
friendliness.”&mdash;<i>Liverpool Daily Post.</i></p>

<p>“A most fascinating narrative.”&mdash;<i>Dublin Evening Herald.</i></p>

<p>“While it will thrill the reader, it will fascinate him too much to

<p>“It is just one of those books which will inevitably be widely read
and talked about.”&mdash;<i>Lincoln Mercury.</i></p>

success.”&mdash;<i>Dublin Freeman’s Journal.</i></p>

nerves to abstain from following the diabolic adventures of Count
Dracula.”&mdash;<i>Sheffield Independent.</i></p>

an uncommon style. Throughout the book there is not a dull
passage.”&mdash;<i>Shrewsbury Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>“Singularly entertaining.”&mdash;<i>Birmingham Daily Mail.</i></p>

<p>“Fascinates the imagination and keeps the reader
chained.”&mdash;<i>Western Times</i> (Exeter).</p>

<p>“We commend it to the attention of readers who like their literary
fare strong, and at the same time healthy.”&mdash;<i>Oban Times.</i></p>

<p>“The most original work of fiction in this almost barren
season.”&mdash;<i>Black and White.</i></p>

<p>“We read it with a fascination which was
irresistible.”&mdash;<i>Birmingham Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“The spell of the book, while one is reading it, is simply
perfect.”&mdash;<i>Woman.</i></p>

<p>“The most blood-curdling novel of the paralysed
century.”&mdash;<i>Gloucester Journal.</i></p>

<i>Crown 8vo, 6s.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“To say that Mr. Meredith is at his best in ‘The Amazing Marriage’ is to
say that he has given us a masterpiece.”&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Meredith belongs to the great school of writers of whom
Aristophanes, Rabelais, Montaigne, Fielding, are some of the most
splendid examples. Mr. Meredith’s style is not ... so obscure as it is
often represented to be.”&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>“Carinthia will take her place ... in the long gallery of those
Meredithian women whom all literary Europe delights to honour.”&mdash;<i>Daily
Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>“By George Meredith! Those three words have a welcome sound for
reviewers.”&mdash;<i>Literary World.</i></p>

<p>“We have said enough to show that Mr. Meredith’s plot is excellently
conceived and excellently carried out.”&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p>

<p>“Most novels are merely dramas with padded stage directions. Mr.
Meredith’s, everybody knows, are otherwise. His novels are always human
life....”&mdash;<i>The Star.</i></p>

<p>“This is a book in which, to use Mr. Meredith’s own expression, you jump
to his meaning.”&mdash;<i>Westminster Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“The book is full of wise, deep, and brilliant things.”&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<i>Imperial 16mo, 6s.</i><br />
</p>

<p>The intention of this book is to present to the public a concise account
of each of the churches of the City of London. If any reader should be
induced to explore for himself these very interesting, but little known
buildings, wherein he cannot fail to find ample to reward him for his
pains, the object of the writer will have been attained.</p>

<p>This volume is profusely illustrated from drawings specially made by Mr.
Leonard Martin, and from photographs which have been prepared expressly
for this work.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The author of this book knows the City churches one and all, and
has studied their monuments and archives with the patient reverence
of the true antiquary, and, armed with the pen instead of the
chisel, he has done his best to give permanent record to their
claims on the nation, as well as on the man in the street.”&mdash;<i>Leeds
Mercury.</i></p>

<p>“His interesting text is accompanied by numerous illustrations,
many of them full-page, and altogether his book is one which has
every claim to a warm welcome from those who have a taste for
ecclesiastical archæology.”&mdash;<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p>

<p>“This is an interesting and descriptive account of the various
churches still extant in London, and is illustrated by several
excellent photographs.... His work will be of value to the
antiquarian, and of interest to the casual observer.”&mdash;<i>Western
Morning News.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Daniell’s work will prove very interesting reading, as he has
evidently taken great care in obtaining all the facts concerning
the City churches, their history and associations.”&mdash;<i>London.</i></p>

<p>“The illustrations to this book are good, and it deserves to be
widely read.”&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p></div>

The Shoulder of Shasta<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">By</span> BRAM STOKER<br />
<br />
<i>Author of</i> “<i>Dracula</i>.”<br />
</p>

<p>“Will be one of the most popular romances, in one volume, of the season
now opening. It is chiefly remarkable for the very marked and superior
descriptive power displayed by the author in his rich and inspiring
picture of the scenery of the Shasta Mountain.... So entirely
unconventional, humorous, and bizarre, as to be quite unique.... The
composition is bold and lucid.... He is an accomplished artist, and
shows here at his best.... Mr. Bram Stoker will add widely to his
reputation by this.”&mdash;<i>Irish Times.</i></p>

<p>“A pure and well-told story.”&mdash;<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p>

<p>“The story is charmingly written, and deserves to be read for its
brilliant open-air passages, and the portrait it contains of Grizzly
Dick.”&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Bram Stoker has given the reading world one of the breeziest and
most picturesque tales of life on the Pacific slope that has been penned
for many a long day.”&mdash;<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Stoker seems quite at home in picturing the wild beauty of
Californian scenery.... ‘The Shoulder of Shasta’ is eminently fresh and
readable.”&mdash;<i>Globe.</i></p>

<p>“It is a capital story.”&mdash;<i>Bristol Times and Mirror.</i></p>

<p>“The story is gracefully conceived, and wrought out with considerable
skill.... A readable and entertaining work.”&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>“&nbsp;‘The Shoulder of Shasta’ may fairly be classed among the books to be
read and enjoyed.”&mdash;<i>Yorkshire Post.</i></p>

<p>“A pleasant story of life in Western America.... Fresh and
unconventional.”&mdash;<i>Publishers’ Circular.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Bram Stoker’s new book is a peculiarly bright and breezy story of
Californian life.... There is nothing laboured in this description, no
straining after undue effect.... The language is simple, yet the effect
is always satisfying, and the word-picture is complete.”&mdash;<i>Liverpool
Daily Post.</i></p>

<p>“The narrative is entertaining throughout, with eloquent descriptions of
scenery.”&mdash;<i>Academy.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Bram Stoker’s story is unflagging, full of vigour, and capital
reading from end to end; moreover, it conveys a vivid picture of life
and manners in a corner of the world better known to him than to the
majority of those who will read his book.”&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p>

character; yet the language is not so antiquated as to present any
serious difficulty to the modern reader. The topics of the letters
relate partly to the private affairs of the family, and partly to the
stirring events of the time: and the correspondence includes State
papers, love letters, bailiff’s accounts, sentimental poems, jocular
epistles, etc.</p>

By SPENSER WILKINSON<br />
<br />
<i>Crown 8vo, 3s. 6d.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“The essence of true policy for Britain, the policy of common-sense,
lies, according to Mr. Wilkinson, in choosing for assertion and for
active defence those points in the extensive fringe of our world-wide
interests, and those moments of time at which our self-defence will
coincide with the self-defence of the world. This idea he works out in a
clever and vigorous fashion.”&mdash;<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p>

<p>“He elaborates his views in four ‘books,’ dealing respectively with the
aims of the other Great Powers, the defence of British interests, the
organization of the Government, and ‘the idea of the nation,’ ... he
deprecates a policy of isolation, and advocates a closer alliance with
Germany.”&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>“We consider Mr. Wilkinson completely proves his case. We agree ... that
Mr. Spenser Wilkinson must make all men think. We welcome the volume, as
we have welcomed previous volumes from Mr. Wilkinson’s pen, as of the
highest value towards the formation of a national policy, of which we
never stood in greater need.”&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

to his words, while the fact that it is already in its fourth edition

<p>“In this very handsome volume Mr. Gleeson White has given us what
is practically an exhaustive account of the admirable results
obtained by designers and wood-engravers during the eventful years
that lie between say 1855 and 1870.... Simply invaluable to all
students and collectors....”&mdash;<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p>

<p>“ ... This sumptuous volume, which Messrs. Constable have printed
with their familiar mastery, and to which have been added the
glories of hand-made paper and beautiful binding. With
characteristic modesty Mr. Gleeson White would claim but the
cataloguer’s place, and would write himself down only the guide to
those who must follow. Certainly in the first instance the volume
is a monument of painstaking research.... But a careful reading
conveys the sense that the historians’ and critics’ parts belong
not less to Mr. Gleeson White. The book, in short, must be in the
hands of all who care for English art. Even those to whom the names
on its title-page are nothing but names, will find it a surprising
picture book, an album, if you will, to lay upon the table, but an
album rich in suggestion and of singular and subtle charm.”&mdash;<i>Pall
Mall Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“We recognise the magnitude of the task undertaken by Mr. Gleeson
White, as well as the care, patience, and learning that he has
bestowed upon its adequate execution. For the printing, binding,
arrangement of illustrations, and spacing of pages, we have nothing
but praise to offer.”&mdash;<i>Manchester Guardian.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Gleeson White has written a work worthy of a foremost place
among the standard reference books on matters artistic. Messrs.
Constable have produced the book in a truly sumptuous
manner.”&mdash;<i>Publisher’s Circular.</i></p></div>

<p>This Atlas is the first publication of its kind, and for tourists and

Twenty-two Plans of the principal towns of our Indian Empire, based on
the most recent surveys, and officially revised to date in India.</p>

<p>The Topographical Section Maps are an accurate reduction of the Survey
of India, and contain all the places described in Sir W. W. Hunter’s
“Gazetteer of India,” according to his spelling.</p>

<p>The Military, Railway, Telegraph, and Mission Station Maps are designed
to meet the requirements of the Military and Civil Service, also
missionaries and business men who at present have no means of obtaining
the information they require in a handy form.</p>

<p>The index contains upwards of ten thousand names, and will be found more
complete than any yet attempted on a similar scale.</p>

<p>Further to increase the utility of the work as a reference volume, an
abstract of the 1891 Census has been added.</p>

to India in future without providing himself with ‘Constable’s Hand

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
